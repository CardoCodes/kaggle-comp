    "Submissions are based on the Brier Score, the goal will be to minimize the brier score between the predicted probabilities and the actual game outcomes. The Brier score measures the accuracy of probablistic predition, in this case the mean square error. \n",
    "\n",
    "The brier score can be thought of as a cost function that measures the average squared difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual outcomes.\n",

    "\n",
    "where $p_i$ is the predicted probability of the event and $o_i$ is the actual outcome. The Brier score can span across all items in a set of N predictions.\n",
